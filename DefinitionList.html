			<h1>Important &ldquo;Computer Studies&rdquo; Definitions</h1>
			<dl>
				<dt>File:</dt>
					<dd>A <span class="emphasis">logical</span> collection of information stored under a single name.</dd>
				<dt>Logical:</dt>
					<dd>The opposite of <span class="emphasis">physical</span>.</dd>
					<dd>Files are <span class="emphasis">logical</span> when broken down and saved to a directory.</dd>
				<dt>Directory:</dt>
					<dd>A <span class="emphasis">logical</span> collection of files  stored under a single name.</dd>
					<dd>Transferring files from directory is faster than transfering files from a computer to another computer</dd>
				<dt>Information:</dt>
					<dd>Words, numbers, pictures and sounds which have meaning to us.</dd>
				<dt>Primary Storage:</dt>
					<dd>Primary storage is a temporary, volatile, fast, and relatively expensive form of storage. The only way this form of storage is processed is through <span class="emphasis">RAM (Random Access Memory)</span> and is only storage than can be accessed directly by the <span class="emphasis">CPU (Central Processing Unit)</span>. It is what is currently happening on the screen, whether it is altering a document or reading a news article, all of it is an example of Primary Storage. However, unless saved to <span class="emphasis">Secondary storage</span>, Primary storage can me lost upon the loss of power, hence the volatile nature mentioned earlier.</dd>
				<dt>Secondary Storage:</dt>
					<dd>Secondary storage is a permanent, non-volatile/stable, slow and cheap form of storage. It is often what goes on behind the scenes when files are saved both <span class="emphasis">logically</span> and <span class="emphasis">physically</span>. Secondary storage can be saved onto a variety of <span class="emphasis">external storage devices</span> such as optical disk, magnetic tape, hard drive, as well as flash memory. Think of it as more of a <span class="emphasis">storage container</span> in its-self.
				<dt>JPEG:</dt>
					<dd> JPEG is a very well-known image file format. As it's name states, it is a standard set by the  <span class="emphasis">&ldquo;Joint Photographic Experts group&rdquo;</span>. Commonly, it is used by digital cameras to store photos because it supports <span class="emphasis">16,777,216</span> different colours. The format also supports multiple levels of compression, which allows it to be ideal for web graphics. The colours in a JPEG image are produced by using <span class="emphasis">8 bits</span> for each colour (Red, Green and Blue) in the <span class="emphasis">RGB colour space</span>. While the JPEG format is rather fantastic for storing digital photos, it does have it's issues. For example, the lossy compression can cause an issue known as <span class="emphasis">&ldquo;artifacting&rdquo;,</span> in which parts of the image tend to become noticeably blocky. </dd>
				<dt>GIF:</dt>
					<dd>Standing for <span class="emphasis">&ldquo;Graphics Interchange Format&rdquo;</span>, GIF is an image file format that is often used for images on the <span class="emphasis">web</span> and <span class="emphasis">sprites</span> in software programs. Unlike the JPEG image format, GIFs uses <span class="emphasis">lossless</span> compression that doesn't degrade the quality of an image. However, GIFs store image data using <span class="emphasis">indexed colour</span>. This means, a standard GIF image can include a maximum of <span class="emphasis">256</span> colors.
				<dt>PNG:</dt>
					<dd>PNG, which can be pronounced <span class="emphasis">&ldquo;ping&rdquo;</span> or <span class="emphasis">&ldquo;P-N-G&rdquo;,</span> is known as a <span class="emphasis">compressed raster graphic format</span>. It is often used on the <span class="emphasis">Web</span> and is also a well known choice for <span class="emphasis">application graphics</span>. PNG includes quite a lot of the benefits of both formats. For example, PNG images use <span class="emphasis">lossless compression</span> like GIF files, this means they do not have any blurring or other <span class="emphasis">artifacts</span> that may appear in JPEG images. The PNG format also supports 24-bit colour like the JPEG format, so a PNG image may include over <span class="emphasis">16 million</span> colours. This is a significant difference between GIF and PNG, since GIF images can include a maximum of <span class="emphasis">256</span> colours. Unlike the JPEG and GIF formats, the PNG format supports an alpha channel, or the &ldquo;RGBA&rdquo; colour space. The alpha channel is added to the three standard colour channels (red, green, and blue, or RGB) as well as <span class="emphasis">variable transparent pixels</span>. JPEG images do not support <span class="emphasis">transparent pixels</span> and GIF images only support <span class="emphasis">completely transparent pixels</span>. Therefore, the PNG format allows Web developers and icon designers to fade an image to a transparent background rather than a specific colour. A PNG with an alpha channel can be placed on any colour background and maintain its original appearance, even around the edges.</dd>
				<dt>PDF:</dt>
					<dd>Standing for <span class="emphasis">&ldquo;Portable Document Format&rdquo;</span>. PDF is a <span class="emphasis">multi-platform</span> file format developed by <span class="emphasis">Adobe Systems</span>. A PDF file has the power to capture document text, fonts, images, and even formatting of documents from many kinds of applications. You may e-mail a PDF document to your friend and it will look the same way on his screen as it looks on yours, even if he has a Mac and you have a PC. Since PDFs contain colour-accurate information, they also print the same way they look on your screen.</dd>
