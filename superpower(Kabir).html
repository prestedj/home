			The Ability to Manipulate the Wind

		<h2>
			What is it?
		</h2>
		<p>
			When my powers are casually brought up in conversation many people very awkwardly ask &#8220;So what are your powers?&#8221; My answer is always &#8220;I control wind, that's it!&#8221;. But for some unknown reason people just do not seem to get what it really is. Leaving the only logical option left is for me to give a little demonstration of my powers. So I take a deep breath and focus on making the winds swirl in one direction and next thing you know I open my eyes and my friends are whirling around in a tornado. Maybe I should stick to just making things fly or something.

		<h2>
			How I got it?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The next most popular question people ask how I got these powers. I'm not surprised since who wouldn't want to be like me. To that I respond with &#8220;These gifts from god are all genetic&#8221;. Yeah I bet you didn't see that coming. My mom's side of the family actually has generations upon generations of people with these types of powers. Most of them are actually still alive today. My mom actually is a lightning bearer herself. So whenever she's realized where I screwed up watch out because those thunderstorms are not the weather, they're never the weather.

		<h2>
			What I do with it?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Finally, people start getting jealous and they try to undermine the sheer destruction I could bring. They enviously ask &#8220;Whatâ€™d you even do with your pointless capabilities&#8221;. Disregarding the  feeling of being utterly disrespected I smugly say &#8220;Well you do realize that the wind constantly twirls around in the sky, and I can control that&#8221;. So what they would yell thinking I'm extremely arrogant but then I'd say one sentence that would shatter their brains. &#8220;That means I can fly&#8221;. That's the last time they ever doubt my potential. But back to flying, imagine never having to take a car or plane or travel normally again, well that's my life.
