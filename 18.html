			<h2>Music Is My Superpower</h2>
			<p>Ever since I could remember music has always had a clutch on every single person on this planet. It may be a different genre, different style or even a different language, but one thing is for certain, music has touched every single one of our lives. Whether it's to add dramatic effect to a movie, tell a story or simply express opinion, music is absolutely everywhere. I, Joshua Prested, am a musician. I mainly play the guitar and sing punk pop and alternative music. To me, music has the power to influence the world, to influence anyone who keeps an open mind and an open ear.</p>
			<h2 class="BecomeMusician">How Did I Become a Musician?</h2>
			<p>When I was quite a bit younger, most likely around the age of nine years old, for a birthday present I had a relative gift me a miniature guitar. It was at this point that I had realized music must have been my destiny. A couple months later, I had joined my first music lessons, working harder and harder to hone my skills and maybe, one day become one of the greats. A chord, B chord, C chord. It was almost as if I knew my music better than the alphabet. From that young age, I knew that I wanted to change the world. I wanted to let them know that I had something to say and nobody could stop me from that. Then came my first day with mic, amp, and stage, my first performance. I was more than ready and so came my song, my realization that music was indeed a power, it can be used for good and evil, to influence today's population for better and for worse, to express opinion biased or not.</p>
			<h2>What Do I Do With Music?</h2>
			<p>Today, I am a member of the band known as &ldquo;The Flying Doorstop Formation&rdquo;. Together, as a band of three brothers and one sister. We combine our musical powers for the greater good. We bring back rock and roll from the dead and remind people that life is about more than your paycheck, more than your job, your biggest car or even your smartphone. We express ourselves through just about every kind of music on the face of the earth and tend to preform rather often to convey our message.</p>
			<p>My Image Was <cite>Musical Ascension</cite> by a person who goes by the name: Musica. It is an ironic photo that implies the strong influence, as well and good an evil of music it's self. This is demonstrated through the many mysic notes Ascending from the guitar.</p>
